SportsRadar-Tennis
Collected competitions category, complexes,venue and competitor rankings JSON data from the Sport Radar API using Python. Processed and stored the data into empty lists using loops, converted it into a Pandas DataFrame, and cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. After cleaning, the DataFrame was exported as a CSV file, which was then uploaded into MySQL workbench for further analysis. Connected MySQL with Python, wrote SQL queries for analysis, and created an interactive Streamlit application for tennis sport data analysis. The app connects to the SQL database, executes queries, converts the results into a DataFrame using Pandas, and visualizes the data for analysis. This workflow integrates data collection, cleaning, processing, storage, uploading, analysis, and visualization seamlessly.
